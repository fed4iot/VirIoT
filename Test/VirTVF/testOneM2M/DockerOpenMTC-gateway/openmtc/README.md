# Python

The OpenMTC SDK is written in and for the Python programming language. Users should therefore have at least a certain knowledge of Python and its paradigms. For this matter, the following material is recommended:

- [The Python Homepage](http://www.python.org)
- [Expert Python Programming by Tarek Ziad√©](http://www.e-reading.by/bookreader.php/138816/Ziade_-_Expert_Python_programming.pdf)
- [Code Like a Pythonista: Idiomatic Python](http://www.omahapython.org/IdiomaticPython.html)
