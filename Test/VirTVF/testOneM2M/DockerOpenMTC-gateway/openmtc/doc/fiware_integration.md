The FIWARE Connector provided by OpenMTC enables the exchange of sensor and actuator data between an OpenMTC Setup and FIWARE Setup with a running Orion Context Broker instance. This way it is possible to access oneM2M sensor data and control oneM2M actuators via FIWARE enabled applications.

OpenMTC together with the FIWARE Connector is available as FIWARE Generic Enabler in the FIWARE Catalogue (Link).
